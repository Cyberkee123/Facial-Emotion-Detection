1.	Introduction

Facial expression recognition is one of the most powerful, natural and immediate means for human beings to communicate their emotions and intensions. Humans can be in some circumstances restricted from showing their emotions, 
such as hospitalized patients, or due to deficiencies; hence, better recognition of other human emotions will lead to effective communication. 
This project specifically focuses on classifying images into seven distinct emotion categories: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. It aims to showcase the power of deep learning, specifically 
2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN2D), in recognizing and categorizing human emotions from spatial data in images.

2.	Business, Ethical & Technical Objectives

Problem Statement: The objective is to build a robust facial emotion recognition model that accurately classifies facial expressions into predefined emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral) from images. 
The challenge lies in handling limited data, class imbalance, lighting variations, pose differences, and subject diversity while maintaining generalization performance.
Business Objective: The goal is to develop a robust AI system that can provide real-time, accurate emotional feedback to improve user engagement and support clinician decision-making.
Ethical Objective: A core priority is to minimize algorithmic bias and ensure the system operates within responsible AI principles, such as maintaining data privacy through local processing.
